<h1>What is a satellite?</h1>
<p>A <u>satellite</u> is an object in space that orbits or circles around a bigger object. There are two kinds of 
satellites: natural (such as the moon orbiting the Earth) or artificial (such as the International Space Station orbiting
the Earth).</p>
<p>There are dozens upon dozens of natural satellites in the solar system, with almost every planet having at least one 
moon. Saturn, for example, has at least 53 natural satellites, and between 2004 and 2017, it also had an artificial one — 
the Cassini spacecraft, which explored the ringed planet and its moons.</p>
